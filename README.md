# My collection of config files

## Usage

To use any of the config files either clone this repository to your local machine and move the config files to their default location to overwrite your own version of that file.

Example
```
cp .bashrc ~
```

Alternatively instead of cloning the entire repository to your machine you can download individual files using the `curl` command with the `-o` flag to select an output file.

Example

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nightmayr/dotfiles/master/.bashrc -o .bashrc
```
